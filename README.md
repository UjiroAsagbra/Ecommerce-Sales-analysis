# Ecommerce-Sales-analysis
A simple analysis of an ecommerce sales data. I used RFM analysis to try to understand customer behaviour and try to find out how much new customers were gained and lost per month.I also tried to understnd customes buying patterns. 

Some of the skills used here include;
Joins, NTILE, CASE, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS.
